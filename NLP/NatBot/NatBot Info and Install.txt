This is a silly project I made that uses a sentiment analyser to create responses based on the assessed sentiment.

It can be fully deployed by following the instructions:

Otherwise, it can be run directly from an IDE, using the first 3 blocks of code. 


To compile and turn this into an EXE:
ensure that Python and Pyinstaller is installed on your PC
open cmd
navigate to path where NatBot.py is located with cd

Run the following in cmd at the location of NatBot.py to generate an EXE:
pyinstaller --onefile --hidden-import=nltk.sentiment.vader --clean --name=NatBot NatBot.py
